# UNSYS Staking Program

A Solana on-chain program built with Anchor for the Uncertain Systems (UNSYS) ecosystem. It provides staking, revenue sharing, partnership management, and data provider registration.

**Program ID:** `8fQT7WjAw2BLYJcbTPYxLciPmUgh5GS4Jj2Vo1uhoK2q`

## Architecture

### On-Chain Accounts

| Account | PDA Seed | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GlobalConfig` | `"global_config_v3"` | Stores mints, vaults, admin, pending admin, dividend epoch, snapshot pools, active partner count |
| `DividendStake` | `"dividend_stake" + user_pubkey` | Per-user dividend stake with lock period, share multiplier, and epoch tracking |
| `PartnershipStake` | `"partnership_stake" + user_pubkey` | Per-user partnership stake with tier, optional referrer, and epoch tracking |
| `DataProviderStake` | `"data_provider_stake" + user_pubkey` | Per-user data provider registration (requires admin activation) |
| `LegacyOmegaStake` | (external) | Read-only account for legacy OMEGA holder verification |

### Token Types

- **UNSYS** -- Utility/governance token used for staking
- **OMEGA** -- Legacy token for migration benefits
- **USDC** -- Revenue distribution token

### Revenue Distribution Model

Revenue deposits are split into two pools via a snapshot mechanism:
- **Dividend Pool (66.67%)**: Distributed proportionally to stakers based on `user_shares / total_shares`
- **Referral Pool (33.33%)**: Split equally among all active partners (`pool / total_active_partners`)

Each deposit increments a `dividend_epoch` counter. Pools **accumulate** across deposits -- unclaimed funds from prior epochs roll forward into the next snapshot. Users can only claim once per epoch, and the snapshot-based calculation ensures all users with equal shares receive identical rewards regardless of claim ordering.

## Instructions (18 total)

### Admin / Setup

| Instruction | Description |
|---|---|
| `initialize` | Creates `GlobalConfig` PDA. Protected against re-initialization. |
| `propose_admin_transfer` | Current admin proposes a new admin. Two-step pattern. |
| `accept_admin_transfer` | Pending admin accepts the transfer by signing. |
| `cancel_admin_transfer` | Current admin cancels a pending transfer. |
| `deposit_revenue` | Admin deposits USDC into revenue vault. Snapshots the deposit into dividend and referral pools. Increments epoch. |
| `validate_data_provider` | Admin activates a pending data provider. PDA-verified. |
| `deactivate_data_provider` | Admin deactivates an active data provider. Required before unstaking. |

### Dividend Staking

| Instruction | Description |
|---|---|
| `stake_dividends` | Lock UNSYS for 3/6/12 months. Shares weighted by multiplier (1.1x / 1.25x / 1.5x). Rejects double-staking and zero amounts. |
| `unstake_dividends` | Returns staked UNSYS after lock period expires. Decrements global shares. Owner-only. |
| `claim_dividends` | Claims proportional USDC from the epoch's dividend pool snapshot. One claim per epoch. |

### Partnership / Referral

| Instruction | Description |
|---|---|
| `stake_partnership` | Stake UNSYS to become a partner (tier 1). Increments active partner count. Rejects double-staking. |
| `unstake_partnership` | Partial or full unstake. Tokens returned. Full unstake revokes tier and decrements partner count. Rejects zero-amount. |
| `claim_referral_share` | Claims equal share of the epoch's referral pool (`pool / total_partners`). One claim per epoch. |

### Data Provider

| Instruction | Description |
|---|---|
| `stake_data_provider` | Stake 5M+ UNSYS to register (starts inactive). Rejects double-staking. |
| `deactivate_data_provider` | Admin deactivates provider. Required before unstaking. |
| `unstake_data_provider` | Returns staked UNSYS. Must be deactivated first. Owner-only. |

### Legacy OMEGA Migration

Past OMEGA token holders can be registered by the admin and then activate both dividend and partnership benefits in a single transaction, without staking any tokens.

| Instruction | Description |
|---|---|
| `register_legacy_holder` | Admin registers a past OMEGA holder by wallet public key. Creates a `LegacyOmegaStake` PDA. Holder doesn't need to sign. Registration is permanent. |
| `enable_legacy_benefits` | Registered holder activates both benefits in one tx: 10B dividend shares + tier-2 partnership. PDA-verified. |
| `revoke_legacy_partnership` | Admin revokes tier-2 partnership status. Registration stays permanent — holder can re-enable if not already staked. |

## Security Features

- **Snapshot-based claims**: Revenue is snapshotted into `epoch_dividend_pool` and `epoch_referral_pool` at deposit time. Claims calculate from the snapshot, not the live vault balance, eliminating early-claimer advantage. Verified by multi-user fairness test.
- **Snapshot + pool decrement**: Each deposit snapshots the pools (`epoch_dividend_snapshot`, `epoch_referral_snapshot`) for fair per-user calculation. Claims decrement the live pool (`epoch_dividend_pool`, `epoch_referral_pool`) to keep on-chain accounting in sync with the vault. Equal-share users always receive identical rewards.
- **Accumulating pools**: Unclaimed funds from prior epochs roll forward (`+=`) into the next snapshot, preventing loss from rapid deposits.
- **Snapshotted partner count**: `epoch_active_partners` is captured at deposit time, preventing mid-epoch partner dilution.
- **Epoch-based claim tracking**: One claim per epoch per user/partner. Prevents vault drain attacks.
- **Per-partner referral split**: Referral pool divided by `total_active_partners` count, not a flat 1/3 of vault. Integer division dust remains in vault (standard on-chain behavior).
- **Two-step admin transfer**: `propose_admin_transfer` + `accept_admin_transfer` + `cancel_admin_transfer` for safe admin rotation.
- **Vault mint and authority validation**: `initialize` verifies `token_vault.mint == unsys_mint`, `revenue_vault.mint == usdc_mint`, and both vaults are owned by the GlobalConfig PDA.
- **Full ATA mint validation**: All claim ATAs verify `mint == usdc_mint`, all staking ATAs verify `mint == unsys_mint`, admin deposit ATA verifies `mint == usdc_mint`. Defense-in-depth alongside CPI checks.
- **Early exit on zero shares**: `claim_dividends` rejects with `NoActiveStake` if `shares == 0` (e.g. after unstake), avoiding wasted compute.
- **Checked arithmetic**: All `total_dividend_shares`, `epoch_dividend_pool`, `epoch_referral_pool`, and `dividend_epoch` operations use `checked_add`/`checked_div`/`checked_sub`/`checked_mul`.
- **PDA-verified GlobalConfig**: Every instruction verifies GlobalConfig via seeds + bump.
- **PDA seed verification on all admin-facing accounts**: `ValidateDataProvider` and `DeactivateDataProvider` verify the `data_provider_stake` PDA.
- **Signer requirements on all mutations**: Claims, unstakes, and stakes require owner signature + PDA constraint.
- **Vault validation**: All vault interactions enforce `vault.key() == global_config.vault`.
- **Token account ownership**: All ATAs validated with `ata.owner == user.key()`.
- **Re-initialization guard**: `initialize` checks `admin == Pubkey::default()`.
- **Double-stake prevention**: All staking instructions check for existing stakes.
- **Lock period enforcement**: `unstake_dividends` checks `clock >= lock_end`.
- **Zero-amount rejection**: All staking, deposits, and unstakes require `amount > 0`.
- **Deactivation-before-unstake**: Data providers must be deactivated by admin before unstaking.
- **Legacy double-registration guard**: `enable_legacy_partnership` checks `staked_amount == 0 && tier == 0`.
- **Anchor events**: All state-changing instructions emit events for off-chain indexing.
